1. Browser req our html file, which has links to bootstrap with styling, and script tad with main.js.
2. Server receives req for main.js. Webpack will take all the modules and combine them together - in main.js
3. Browser starts to execute frontend code.
4. Entry point - index.js:
- Importing react, reactdom, app from packages and modules
- Accessing our div #root from html
- Creating container
- Telling react to mount our App
- App is starting

5. App.jsx:
- Importing react from package
- jwtDecode from package                        // to decode, verify and generate tokens
- AppContext from './lib/app-context' module    // provides data to components
- parseRoute from './lib/parse-route' module    // see below - used to switch a views
- Auth from './pages/auth' module
- Home from './pages/home' module
- NotFound from './pages/not-found' module
- Navbar from './components/navbar' module
- PageContainer from './components/page-container' module

We are defining class App (which extends from React.Component and being exported by default). App has its construction function. State is set.
Render runs:
1. Checks the state
2. Sets contextValues
3. Returns:
- AppContext with Provider React component => imported from AppContext './lib/app-context' => in app-context.js we creating a context instance and exported it by default
- Navbar component =>
  - In Navbar class component we are rendering some react elements and accsessing  properties from context property (which we “defined/assigned” in app “const contextValue = { user, route, handleSignIn, handleSignOut }”).
  - In render() we are checking if user is null => show Sign In and Sign Up buttons, if not => show Sign out:
    - method handleSignOut is passed from App.jsx with context
    - called when button is clicked
    - handleSignOut method removes data from local storage => and sets new state => App.jsx rerenders
  - After rendering we are going back to App
- PageContainer component “is being called with one arg”. Going to page-container.jsx:
  - Function PageContainer is defined with one parameter and returning react el with given argument. + we have some styling assigned to const styles. Going back to App
- Calls the renderPage() of this obj - is a javascript expression which is passed to PageContainer => renderPage() method:
  - route is parsed (with parseRoute in ./lib/parse-route => returns an obj:
    - Checks if contains #, chops it off and splits on “?” one section before ‘?’ = path (string), second one = queryString)
    - Using URLSearchParams for “getting” key value pairs from queryString
  - Checks if our path is empty str if it is, shows Home component (home page). Going to home.jsx =>
    - We have some styling assigned to const styles and being applied later
    - Class Home is being defined (which extends from React.Component and being exported by default)
    -  Checks if user (from context) is trufy
    - If yes, returns react el with styling (javascript expression)
    - If not - returns Redirect component with “to” props = to str “sign-in”
        - Redirect in ../components/redirect holds a function Redirect (which is being exported by default) with one parameter props.
        - Checks if property of “to” (passed argument in home.jsx) is empty str, if yes - assign # to hash property of url obj. If no - assign value of ‘to’ to url.hash
    - Then use replace method to on window location with new url to redirect user
  - Check if path is sign-in or sign-up, if so return Auth component =>
    - Auth imports a bunch of necessary modules and react package
    - And a class Auth is being defined (which extends from React.Component and being exported by default)
    - In the class body we again accessing and assigning properties from context to use (const { user, route, handleSignIn } = this.context)
    - Checking if user signed in - show http://localhost:3000/# (with Redirect fun see above).
    - We are creating welcome message to show: if path “sign-in” - Please sign in to continue, if not - then (“sign—up”) - Create an account to get started!
    -  Returning react el with AuthForm component with props - key={route.path} action={route.path} onSignIn={handleSignIn} - with value of handleSignIn() defined in App.jsx ans passed with context =>
      - handleSignIn method WILL “take” user and token from result obj in fetch requst (see below) - and store it local storage - will set state in App.jsx => and WILL RENDER again (the matching pages and buttons are shown)

     // handleSignIn was passed through context, and assign to onSignIn prop of AuthForm
      - Going to AuthForm in ‘../components/auth-form’:
          - Importing react from package and AppContext to access necessary values
          - Constructor fun is called with props and super fun is called. State is set to username and password as empty strings
          - Render method is next.
            - We are destructuring props property for action value. And also for  handleChange, handleSubmit from this obj.
              - We checking if const action is === to “sign—up”, if yes assign new value of “sign-in” to const alternateActionHref, if not - assign “sign—up”.
              - We checking if const action is === to “sign—up”, if yes assign new value of “Sign in instead” to a const alternatActionText, if not -  assign “Register now”
              - We checking if const action is === to “sign—up”, if yes assign new value of 'Register' to const submitButtonText, if not -  assign str 'Log In'
              - And then we returning react el type form, with a onSubmit={handleSubmit}
                - In which we are destructuring props property for action value
                - Setting our request obj with method post, and header , and with JSON.stringify in body
                - Fetch will send request to /api/auth/ and the value of action we are on => server starts - index.js runs one time:
                  - App.listen starts and listens for requests
                  - errorMiddleware is “imported” and in use
                  - …
                  - We enter callback for post for either /api/auth/sign-up or /api/auth/sign-in depends on the value is const action
                  - We creating the sql str with userId, hashedPassword, if user is signing in.
                      - And we query our database with arguments of username and sql str
                        - When server receives a reply from database we destructuring array of result row and assigning value to user const.
                        - If user is falsy , we are throwing an error, which takes us to error-middleware.js:
                            - There we assign value to JsonWebTokenError, which is a return from a require fun with jsonwebtoken package argument
                            - And we assign value of a return of a require fun with './client-error' arg to a const ClientError
                            - In errorMiddleware fun with four args which is taking care of all errors // sorry I can’t anymore
                            - With argon2 we are comparing hashed password with password given by user
                            - If it is not matching - we throw error
                            - If it is matches - we are creating payload obj with userId and username
                            - After jwt.sign() uses the data in the payload, and the TOKEN_SECRET value from .env to create a token.
                            - Token, user (as payload obj) are send as response from database to server
                        - If value of action is sign-up:
                            - We making sure username and password are provided, if not - error is thrown
                            - With argon2 we hashing the password
                            - Creating sql str with insert method, choosing the table and “columns”, placing two placeholders for values (username, hashedPassword)
                            - After server query database
                            - Result is sent back as “user” (with  "userId", "username", "createdAt")
                 - If user was singing in and a token and a user are trufy => this.props.onSignIn(result) //??? Result of request is passed as arg to onSignIn method. ??
            - Form inputs have onChange handlers with handleChange =>
            - In this method we are listen for inputs from user (username and password)
            - If event happens we are assigning value of input the state with setState, which will rerender our form
          - And few javascript expression passed in the react el (see above which)
  - Else return NotFound component =>
    - Here we have some styling to apply ro react el
    - Component renders el with Not found text, and renders anchor el with ‘view’ of a homescreen href="#"
App.lsx - componentDidMount!!!
 - Now we are listening for ‘hashchange event’, if hash changes we reset the state and render again.
  - We are getting token from local storage
    - If where is a token - we are decoding it not - null
  - After we set the status again to user data (dec token) and isAuthorizing to false =>
  App renders
And finaly App component is mounted to the #root (it will render again if user interacts with the page - sing up, sing in, sing out).
